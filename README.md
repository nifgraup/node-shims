node-shims
==========

This repository contains a basic set of shims for commonly used node API for use in Chrome Packaged Apps. Most notably net/tls (TCP socket) APIs. Unlike [node-browser-builtins](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/node-browser-builtins), which is used by browserify, we do not require an additional build step, since we use [amdefine](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine) to build AMD modules that can be used in the browser [via requirejs](http://www.requirejs.org) and node environments alike.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/node-shims.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/node-shims)

## Usage

In a node enviroment, the native node API is provided. In a Chrome environment, the shims are used. This repo may serve as a drop-in replacement for the builtin node packages in your node module:

    var shims = require('node-shims'),
        util = shims.util;

To run the tests in node, do the following:

    > npm install
    > npm test

To run the tests in Chrome as a Chrome packaged app, do the following:

    > npm install
    > grunt copy
    > node test-server.js

    open Chrome
    go to chrome://extensions/ 
    activate developer mode
    load node-shims as unpacked extension
    watch the tests pass
